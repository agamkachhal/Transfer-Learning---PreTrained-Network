# Transfer-Learning---PreTrained-Network
Building a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and then applying Transfer Learning to a Pretrained network and later on applying Data Augmentation to the Pretrained Network.

### Steps Involved

`1.` Building a small CNN from scratch with two versions. One version has dropout layers but the other doesn't.
`2.` Train both versions on the
